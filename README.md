# QFE_Calculator
Little Android app that calculates the QFE at the target point. Intended to use with the AJS-37 Viggen for DCS.

How to use:

1) Bring up your Mission Briefing (Also works ingame) and Note the Temperature.
2) Bring up your kneeboard and take note of the QFE at your takeoff waypoint
3) Go to F10, put the mouse over your target and note the elevation (watch the Units, select the appropriate button in the app)
4) Now (still F10 map) put the mouse over your takeoff-runway and note the elevation (watch the Units, select the appropriate button in the app)
5) Press the calculate button
6) Adjust your Viggen's altimeter to the QFE output
7) Watch your ememies blow up

You can't really do anything wrong. Should any of your inputs be off (such as letters), the app will notify you of that.

Once I have verified the application runs stable and settled with a design I like, I will also put this onto the Android App Store. I wish I could do one for the iPhone but I simply refuse to learn a whole new language for just one platform and I won't pay any money for them to authorize the app. Sorry guys!
Enjoy!

FOR USE IN DCS:WORLD ONLY! PRECISION OF THESE COMPUTATIONS IT NOT GUARANTEED NOR IS THIS APPLICATION DESIGNED TO BE USED WITH A REAL AIRPLANE!
