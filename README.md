# QFE_Calculator
Little Android app that calculates the QFE at the target point. Intended to use with the AJS-37 Viggen for DCS.

How to use:

1) Bring up your Mission Briefing (Also works ingame) and Note the Temperature.
2) Bring up your kneeboard and take note of the following data:
  2.1) QFE at Takeoff
  2.2) Elevation at Takeoff
3) Go to F10, put the mouse over your target and note the elevation in meters
4) Put the numbers in the app, touch the button, and there's your QFE.

You can't really do anything wrong. Should any of your inputs be off (such as letters), the app will notify you of that.

Once I have verified the application runs stable and settled with a design I like, I will also put this onto the Android App Store. I wish I could do one for the iPhone but I simply refuse to learn a whole new language for just one platform and I won't pay any money for them to authorize the app. Sorry guys!
Enjoy!
